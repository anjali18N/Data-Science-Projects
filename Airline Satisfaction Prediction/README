# Airline Satisfaction Prediction

This project uses a dataset from Invistico Airline to predict customer satisfaction using logistic regression. It involves data preprocessing, handling missing values, one-hot encoding of categorical variables, and model evaluation using classification metrics.

## Project Structure

- `airline_satisfaction.py`: Python script with code for preprocessing, training, and evaluating the model.
- `Invistico_Airline.csv`: Dataset used for the project.

## Dataset

The dataset includes the following columns:
- `Gender`
- `Customer Type`
- `Type of Travel`
- `Class`
- `satisfaction`: Target variable (satisfied or dissatisfied)

## Model Pipeline

1. **Data Preprocessing**: One-hot encoding for categorical variables, imputation of missing values for both numerical and categorical columns.
2. **Model Training**: Logistic Regression is used to predict customer satisfaction.
3. **Model Evaluation**: The model's performance is evaluated using a classification report and a confusion matrix.

## Results

- **Classification Report**: Provides precision, recall, F1-score, and support for each class.
- **Confusion Matrix**: Shows the number of true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative predictions.

## Feature Coefficients

The project also extracts and displays the coefficients of the features, sorted by their impact on the target variable.
