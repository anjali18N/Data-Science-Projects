# Realtor Price Prediction

This project uses a dataset of real estate listings to predict house prices based on various features such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, lot size, and city. The model utilizes a linear regression algorithm with one-hot encoding for the categorical feature (city).

## Project Structure

- `realtor_price_prediction.py`: The Python script containing the code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `realtor-data-sample.csv`: The dataset used for the project.

## Dataset

The dataset (`realtor-data-sample.csv`) includes the following columns:
- `bed`: Number of bedrooms.
- `bath`: Number of bathrooms.
- `acre_lot`: Size of the lot in acres.
- `city`: City where the house is located.
- `price`: The target variable representing the price of the house.

## Model Pipeline

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Handles missing values and applies one-hot encoding to the `city` column.
2. **Model Training**: Uses Linear Regression to fit the model to the training data.
3. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluates the model using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² score.

## Results

- **Mean Squared Error**: The average squared difference between the predicted and actual values.
- **R² Score**: The proportion of variance in the dependent variable that can be predicted from the independent variables.

## Feature Coefficients

The project also extracts and displays the coefficients of the features after one-hot encoding. This helps in understanding the influence of each feature on the house prices.

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python installed along with the necessary libraries: `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `numpy`, and `matplotlib`.
2. Run the script using the following command:
   
   python realtor_price_prediction.py
